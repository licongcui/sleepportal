== Installation

NOTE: We assume you have already installed RVM, or the very least the latest version of Ruby (1.9.3 of this writing), and that you have the bundler gem installed.

  gem install bundler

This README assumes the following installation directory: /var/www/hybrid

  cd /var/www

  git clone git://github.com/sleepepi/hybrid.git

  cd hybrid

  bundle install --without oracle mssql

Install default configuration files for database connection, email server connection, server url, and application name.

  ruby lib/initial_setup.rb

  bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production

Run Rails Server (or use Apache or nginx)

  rails s -p80

Open a browser and go to: http://localhost

All done!

== Contributing to Hybrid

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
